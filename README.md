# WAMCalculator
 WAM Calculator along with an unit mark calculator.

 Whilst using the initial WAM Calculator provided by the university website, I found many inconvenience such as not being able to delete units that have been accidently added and having to refresh the whole page, unnecessary content being displayed such as how the WAM was calculated, which may bebeneficial for a proportion of users but not for the majority, and the design that falls off trends. To cover these points, I've created a new WAM Calculator.

 Along with the WAM Calculator, Iâ€™ve created an unit mark calculator that allows students to predict their unit marks by inputting their current assignment marks and their predicted exam/assignment marks.
